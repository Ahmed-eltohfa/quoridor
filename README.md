# 🎲 About Quoridor

Quoridor is a two-player strategy board game played on a **Usually 9×9** board.

Each player starts with:

- One pawn
- Ten walls

On each turn, a player can either:

- Move their pawn
- Place one wall

The objective is simple:

> Reach the opposite side of the board before your opponent.

Walls make the game interesting—they can block your opponent's path, but **they can never completely trap a player**. There must always remain at least one valid path to the goal.

---

# 🕹️ Gameplay

Every turn you may choose one action:

### Move your pawn

Move one square:

- Up
- Down
- Left
- Right

If the opponent is directly in front of you, jumping over them is allowed according to Quoridor's official rules.

### Place a wall

Walls can be placed either:

- Horizontally
- Vertically

The game automatically validates every placement to ensure that both players always have at least one valid path to their destination.

---

# 🤖 AI Opponents

Play against computer-controlled opponents powered by the **Minimax algorithm**.

The AI includes:

- Multiple difficulty levels
- Strategic wall placement
- Move evaluation
- Alpha-Beta pruning optimization
- Pathfinding analysis

Higher difficulties search deeper into the game tree, making the AI increasingly challenging.

# 🚀 Getting Started

## Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ahmed-eltohfa/quoridor.git
```

## Enter the project

```bash
cd quoridor
cd client
npm install

cd ../server
npm install
```

---

# ▶️ Running the Project

Start the backend:

```bash
npm run server
```

Start the frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or use the project's available scripts if they differ.

---

# 🌐 Multiplayer

Players can:

- Join queue
- Play in real time
- Synchronize moves instantly
- Handle player disconnects gracefully

---

# 🧠 Game Engine

The project contains a custom-built Quoridor engine responsible for:

- Pawn movement
- Wall placement
- Move validation
- Jump mechanics
- Win detection
- Pathfinding validation
- Turn management
- Undo functionality

Keeping the game logic separate from the UI makes the project easier to maintain and extend.

---

# 💡 Challenges

Some interesting technical challenges solved during development include:

- Designing the complete Quoridor game engine from scratch
- Synchronizing multiplayer game state
- Implementing intelligent AI using Minimax
- Preventing illegal wall placements
- Validating paths after every wall placement
- Managing game rooms and player sessions
- Keeping the UI synchronized across clients

# 📈 Future Improvements

- Spectator mode
- Match replay
- Tournament mode
- Chat during games
- More AI personalities
- Mobile application
- Custom themes
